# Soil-moisture-anomaly-detection-
This repository is to showcase my work done as a part time student intern at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies (NCICS). It involves exploring and analysing  real world soil moisture measurement data in order to use Machin Learning techniques for anomaly detection.

It involved multiple rounds of data cleaning and preprocessing with discussions with stakeholders, and exploring the use of XGBoost and isolation forests to establish baseline performance and to show Machine Learning techniques can be used to automate the quality control process in detection and flagging anomalous sensor readings.
